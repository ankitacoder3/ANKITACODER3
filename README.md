### Hi there 👋

###
### This is Ankita. 
### I am an Artificial Intelligence - Machine Learning enthusiast.
### I have worked on several projects in the field of AI-ML. During my last few semesters, me and my team built various AI-ML models, like movie recommendation model, telecom churn prediction model, etc. 
### I have also had the opportunity to work on cutting-edge technologies in AI-ML in the various internships. In one of the internships, I built an AI-ML model that will give the logic of the energy production experiments, they were working on, and hence help them in producing excess energy. In another internship, I built an AI-ML model, using Convolution Neural Networks (for image detection and classification). 
### I aim to use the knowledge I have learnt, in various projects and applications that I shall work on, to benifit the organization and society.
