#### âš¡ AI-ML projects : Movie recommendation model, Telecom churn prediction model, etc. 
###
<!--### I have worked on several projects in the field of AI-ML. During my last few semesters, me and my team built various AI-ML models, like movie recommendation model, telecom churn prediction model, etc. 
### I have also had the opportunity to work on cutting-edge technologies in AI-ML in the various internships. In one of the internships, I built an AI-ML model that will give the logic of the energy production experiments, they were working on, and hence help them in producing excess energy. In another internship, I built an AI-ML model, using Convolution Neural Networks (for image detection and classification). -->
